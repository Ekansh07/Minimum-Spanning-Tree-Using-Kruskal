Objective:

     Work with graphs and Kruskals algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

Overview:

     Your program will find the minimum spanning tree
     among a set of cities in Texas using Kruskals Algolrithm.

Details:

     Write a command-line program that uses Kruskal's algorithm to find a minimum spanning
     tree of a graph.  The graph will be provided as a file named Data.csv.  The
     data in the file is in the form of an adjacency list.

     Output each edge of minimum spanning tree as the names of the two
     cities and the distance between them.  Also print the sum of all of the
     distances in the tree.
